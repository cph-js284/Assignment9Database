# Assignment9Database
This is the 9th assignment for PBA Database soft2019spring

# What it is
This is a project with a jupyter notebook containing the answers to the assignment

# Setup
You can either clone the repo and open the jupyter notebook locally, or view it online [here](https://github.com/cph-js284/Assignment9Database/blob/master/RelationalAlgebra.ipynb) <br>
*The online view is a little funky, due to Github adding an extra interpretation layer on top of the cells*
